_ANY_ help is welcomed!
Be that in the form of issues, critiques about documentation, code or ideas!

Please just be sure to follow these steps:
1. Be sure to write your changes into an <your-name>-<feature> branch.
2. Do _not_ use python, rust, C, whatever language, only use bash and ansible.*
3. Write all of your printed messages into lib/ui.sh in the form of an _variable_, that way we can easily translate the scripts.

*you _can_ use PYTHON for necessary evils, but it should be used or called in an script.
